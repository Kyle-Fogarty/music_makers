# Music Makers

The main script that needs to be uploaded to the Arduino board is located within the `arduino_main` folder of this directory. To upload the sketch we recommend that you use the Arduino IDE, which can be obtained from [arduino.cc](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software).

## Getting started

1. Open the Arduino IDE and load in the `arduino_main.ino` file (`File -> Open -> select_file`).
1. Connect the Arduino board to the computer and set the port it is attached to (`Tools -> Ports -> your_port`)
1. Upload the sketch to the board using upload button (2nd button on the top left of the IDE)
