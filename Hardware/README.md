# Hardware
You can either build the system as is or you may need to modify the design to fit your recorder. Please see [Modifying the Design](#modifying-the-design) for instructions.

## You Will Need

- 1 x Recorder - we used the Aulos A205.
- 1 x [Blowing Module](Blowing%20Module).
- 1 x [Fingering Module](Fingering%20Module).
- 1 x Arduino Mega (with USB cable).
- 1 x High sensitivity sound sensor module.

## Assembly Instructions

## Modifying the Design
If you need to modify the design (for example the tone hole spacings on your recorder are different) the source of our CAD models is given using STEP files which can be found in each module's folder. These can be downloaded and edited using your favourite CAD platform. [FreeCAD](https://www.freecadweb.org/index.php) is a good open source option.
