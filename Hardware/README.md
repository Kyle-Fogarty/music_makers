# Hardware
You can either build the system as is or you may need to modify the design to fit your recorder. Please see [Modifying the Design](#modifying-the-design) for instructions.

## You Will Need

- 1 x Recorder - we used the Aulos A205.
- 1 x [Blowing Module](Blowing%20Module).
- 1 x [Fingering Module](Fingering%20Module).

## Assembly Instructions
1. Gather and make everything required in the 'You Will Need' list according to the instructions within each module.
2. Insert the recorder into the Fingering Module.
3. Push the mouthpiece connector of the Blowing Module onto the recorder mouthpiece.
4. Connect ground, SDA and SCL between the Arduinos of the Blowing and Fingering modules.

## Modifying the Design
If you need to modify the design (for example the tone hole spacings on your recorder are different) the source of our CAD models is given using STEP files which can be found in each module's folder. These can be downloaded and edited using your favourite CAD platform. [FreeCAD](https://www.freecadweb.org/index.php) is a good open source option.
